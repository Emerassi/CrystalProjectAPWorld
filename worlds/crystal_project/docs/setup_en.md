  [Crystal Project AP World Releases Page](https://github.com/Emerassi/CrystalProjectAPWorld/releases)

## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

A YAML file lets you configure options for your randomizer game.
See [Archipelago Multiworld Setup Guide](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en#generating-a-game) for a more in-depth explanation!

### Where do I get a YAML file?

A YAML file is included on the [Crystal Project AP World Releases Page](https://github.com/Emerassi/CrystalProjectAPWorld/releases)

### Connect to the MultiServer

Start a new game in Crystal Project. Don't touch the in-game randomizer settings (some of them may still work, but some of them will break things lol).
Once loaded into the world, open the menu and select Archipelago from the sidebar.
Fill out the hostname and port (archipelago.gg: ######), slot name, and password (if applicable), and hit the Save button. You should now be connected!
(Note: settings like starting job randomization will only apply after you've connected to the multiworld for the first time.)

### Play the game

After you've successfully connected once, your save file will automatically reconnect to the multiworld the next time you open the game.
(Remember to refresh the multiworld room page if no one has connected in a while.)
Set forth on adventure!
